How to always win at Battle for Wesnoth ?
=========================================

In my spare time, I sometime play at [Battle for
Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org) which is a turn per turn strategy game. In
some advanced campaigns you should fight very dangerous ennemies and you
*MUST* not loose any heros. That's why I use this simple GNU awk script
to parse saves and tweak some part of it.

How it works ?
--------------

This parser parse each unit parameters which match a specific regular
expression. For each value at a specific parameter you store the value
in a variable.

The quick and dirty part of the script is that it print modified values
when parsing `side="n"`. Thus all the values have to be in the root of
the unit. It cannot be used to modify unit capacities.

How to use ?
------------

The default save format is the compressed plain-text. Thus you need an
extract-transform-and-compress command. The next command parse the
Modif-old.gz file, transform it and save it to a Modif.gz file.

`zcat Modif-old.gz |gawk -f save.awk |gzip > Modif.gz`
